    "Suppose you are a language expert, and you will receive a guess about the persuadee's mental state from the persuader. You need to provide feedback to the persuader to help them correct their guess, based on the scenario (including the true mental state) and the conversation history, enabling them to guide the conversation more effectively.\n",
